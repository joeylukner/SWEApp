# SWEApp
This is the android studio app I created with project group mates Sarah Conley and Hayden Brown under the assistance of Professor Chris Murphy of Swarthmore College in my SoftWare Engineering Class

This repository contains the files for the Android Studio Project, the mobile app itself of our project
titled Find Your Foodie. Accompanied by the Node Express App we created, located in the same repository, the
user can create and edit their profile, add restaurants they want to go to, rate restaurants,
and message other users on the
app. Administrators can also access the database through our web app. While the node app is running, try the url http://hostname:3004
in your browser.
